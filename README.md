# Walker Development Studio

This is my personal site, used to display my portfolio of work, to interest clients and otherwise just add things
going on, as well as being able to reach out to me.

## The Site

This site is built using GitHub pages, Jekyll and the usual HTML5, CSS3 (SASS) and JavaScript.

SASS libraries include Unsematic UI [https://unsemantic.com/] with an override written by me to be able to use shorthand classes,
just so the code is less cluttered and a bit easier to read.
